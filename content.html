	<h1> What I learned From The Richest Man in Babylon </h1>
	<p> 	Save 1/10th of your income or more every year or everyday. It doesn't matter the time but everytime you earn money you have to 
	divide in two parts one part: 1/10th(or more) and other part: 9/10th part. And you can spend the 9/10th part but don't touch 1/10th 
	part.
	
	However, a common mistake i think many of us will make or I would make is that i would be overconfident on my saving capbilites and
	save more than i could and so, save alot. But that wouldn't last long. Because, one day i would be tired of bondage and my mind would 
	convince me to give up.
	
	So, a better approach would be to not be too greedy and just save enough which wouldn't hamper you daily life.
	
	Invest that saved money where you think you can get return. Be careful with the investment. Listen or understand as much as you can (but not
	too much) about the investment. Then, do what you feel like doing. Whatever your gut says or your brain says.
	
	Sharpen the saw. Be a continous learner. It would be easier to do this if you loved the thing you were doing. So, it would be easier to
	work in that and be better at that. You know wu wei of taoism.
	
	Make an money making army. Build your army, an empire which works and earns automatically by being consistent with you savings and
	by being careful with your investments.  </p>
